How can we improve the quality of our RAG?

Certain queries identify cracks in our data quality. For example,
- "What's the most significant strikes that Islam Makhachev had in a fight?"

Since the UFC fight stats dataset is set up so each record corresponds to a fighter's round in a given fight, 
asking questions about the "fight" put the onus of rolling up round-specific rows on the LLM.

I would hypothesize that a dataset based around a "fight" model and/or a "fighter" model would yield
much better LLM responses, since it wouldn't have to worry about aggregating data across rounds - that would
be handled in pre-processing.

"fight" model:
- similar to the existing dataset, except we would flatten the round-by-round data into one fight-level row

"fighter" model:
Sample row: {
    "Henry Cejudo": "One big paragraph that summarizes all of the particular fighters fights"
}
