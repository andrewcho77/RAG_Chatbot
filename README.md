Thank you to Greco1899 for his up to date UFC [data sets](https://github.com/Greco1899/scrape_ufc_stats)

- Right now, we are parsing and populating the Pinecone vector DB with round-by-round UFC fight statistics.
- Future features will include fighter details like reach and stance as well as fight outcomes.
